Parameter -- Meaning

param[t] -- parameter value calculated for year t
m.param -- Bayesian estimated (within model) mean param value across years

N.1 -- COUNT of first-time (i.e., SY) breeding birds in the total population
N.a -- COUNT of returning breeders (i.e., ASY) in the total population
N.imm -- COUNT of immigrants  (in this case, but not always, equal to our immigration param omega)
Ntot -- COUNT of total population

phi1 -- Juvenile survival rate, 0-1, or the rate at which a nestling year t returns after its first winter to breed in year t+1

phia -- Adult survival rate, 0-1, or the rate at which a breeding adult in year t returns to breed in year t+1

omega -- COUNT of immigrant birds in year t

prod -- productivity, or the number of (in this case) juveniles produced per nest in year t


lambda -- derived parameter, Ntot[t+1]/Ntot[t]
immRate -- derived parameter, omega[t]/Ntot[t]
